If you plan to contribute to TRS, you have a big task ahead of you! There's a lot of complicated bits and pieces to this app.

This text document aims to point you in the right direction to learning the internals of the app with as little friction as possible.

Coupled with the expansive docs I've written + ample comments present in the code, this class is your sort of "mall map" around the app.

For instance, the process of conversion begins in one of two locations depending on the type of input data:
- Was a MODEL input? Check out ThreeRingsSharp.DataHandlers.ModelConfigBrancher
- Was a SCENE input? Check out ThreeRingsSharp.DataHandlers.TudeySceneConfigBrancher

These two classes will direct you around appropriately, coupled with knowing how to read C#.
