### What's happening?
Describe what's going on here, and be clear about it! It's helpful if you send the `latest.log` file in the same folder as the exe too, as this will fill in many of the blanks for me.

### How do I make it happen?
Describe the EXACT steps needed to cause this issue here in clear detail. Think of it like if you were trying to teach your grandma how to break my program.
