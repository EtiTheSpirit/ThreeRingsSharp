### What's happening?
Describe what's going on here, and be clear about it! It's helpful if you send the `latest.log` file in the same folder as the exe too, as this will fill in many of the blanks for me.

### What model?
If you noticed this problem when trying to convert something, what model is breaking? Provide the file path to the model relative to the `rsrc` folder, for example: `rsrc/character/npc/monster/gremlin/null/model.dat`. If you weren't using a model, either erase this section or just don't write anything.

### What settings?
Does the model have any customizable attributes (blue text in the lower data tree)? If so, did you change any of this data? What was the original value? What did you set it to? Does it work fine if you use the original value? If you weren't using a model, either erase this section or just don't write anything.

### How do I make it happen?
Describe the EXACT steps needed to cause this issue here in clear detail. Think of it like if you were trying to teach your grandma how to break my program.
