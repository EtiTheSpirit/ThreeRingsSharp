### What is the feature?
Describe what you think should be added. If possible, try completing this sentence: *When using TRS, it is currently too hard to / impossible to ...* -- A feature request made to solve a problem is far more valuable than a random idea (not that they aren't good, it's just solving problems is more important!)

### Use Cases
How can this feature be used? A feature isn't a good feature unless it's got a reason to exist and be used in the first place.
