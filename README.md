# ThreeRingsSharp
A port of OOO's Clyde, Narya, Nenya, and Vilya libraries (as well as their dependencies) into C# via IKVM because let's face it: Java is kinda stupid.

The collective library is referred to as "ThreeRingsSharp" and provides access to the applicable libraries via IKVM's C#-based Java interface. It also provides a number of utilities designed for the extraction and translation of model data exported by Clyde into common 3D model formats.

This repository effectively represents "Spiral Knights Animator Tools 2".
