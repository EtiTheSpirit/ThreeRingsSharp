# ThreeRingsSharp

Abbreviated as TRS, TR#, or OOO# (since any of these might work), this is port of ThreeRings (now Grey Havens)'s Clyde, Narya, Nenya, and Vilya libraries (as well as their dependencies) into C# via IKVM because let's face it: Java is kinda stupid.

# Completion Warning
This is NOT FUNCTIONAL! You can track progress on [Project #1: Initial Program Design](https://github.com/XanTheDragon/ThreeRingsSharp/projects/1)

# About
The collective library is referred to as "ThreeRingsSharp" and provides access to the applicable libraries via IKVM's C#-based Java interface. It also provides a number of utilities designed for the extraction and translation of model data exported by Clyde into common 3D model formats. It is written and compiled with docs, and is intended to be used by other people in their own libraries too.

This repository effectively represents "Spiral Knights Animator Tools 2".

# Licensing Notice
All referenced DLL files that have been converted with IKVM are, for obvious reasons, not included in the MIT license associated with ThreeRingsSharp. The license included strictly applies to the code I have authored in this project.
