# ThreeRingsSharp
Abbreviated as TRS or TR#, this is port of Grey Havens's *Clyde*, *Narya*, *Nenya*, and *Vilya* libraries (as well as their dependencies) into C# via IKVM, because let's face it: Java is kinda stupid.

This program rips models from any Clyde-based game (mostly intended for Spiral Knights) and converts it to the glTF 2.0 format so you can use it for animations or whatever it may be.

# About
The collective library is referred to as "ThreeRingsSharp" and provides access to the applicable libraries via IKVM's C#-based Java interface. It also provides a number of utilities designed for the extraction and translation of model data exported by Clyde into common 3D model formats. It is written and compiled with docs, and is intended to be used by other people in their own libraries too.

This repository effectively represents "Spiral Knights Animator Tools 2".
